## Second Semester

### Week 1

During this week I found my biggest problems occured in the group project. The main problems were getting both myself and the team on the whole back up to speed with the devlopment of Nebula Knights.

### Week 2

I feel by this week I had become comfortable working within Unreal's visula programming environment 'Blueprint'. This has sped up my rate of work greatly and has allowed me to help the rest of my team become comfortable within the environment too.

### Week 3

In week threee my biggest challenge came when I had to miss a few sessions due to illness. This meant that I had to catch up on those sessions and continue to work on Nebula Knights. This put a big strain on my time management skills, but I feel that I managed to cope quite well.

### Week 4 

I feel that in week 4 the biggest challenge was coming to grips ith UML. This was because I had missed the previous class on it due to illness the week before and had caught up myself, meaning I had a lesser understanding than most other students. I feel that really focussing in that class helped me to grow my knowledge on the area faster. Perhaps I could look at future topics in detail before we study them more?
