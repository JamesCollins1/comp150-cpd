## Second Semester

### Week 1

During this week I found my biggest problems occured in the group project. The main problems were getting both myself and the team on the whole back up to speed with the development of Nebula Knights.

### Week 2

I feel by this week I had become comfortable working within Unreal's visula programming environment 'Blueprint'. This has sped up my rate of work greatly and has allowed me to help the rest of my team become comfortable within the environment too.

### Week 3

In week three my biggest challenge came when I had to miss a few sessions due to illness. This meant that I had to catch up on those sessions and continue to work on Nebula Knights. This put a big strain on my time management skills, but I feel that I managed to cope quite well.

### Week 4 

I feel that in week 4 the biggest challenge was coming to grips ith UML. This was because I had missed the previous class on it due to illness the week before and had caught up myself, meaning I had a lesser understanding than most other students. I feel that really focussing in that class helped me to grow my knowledge on the area faster. Perhaps I could look at future topics in detail before we study them more?

### Week 5 

My biggest challenge during week 5 was to trying to get to grips with setting up a server. I found this difficult as it was a new specialist task that I'd never done anything like before. In this session we learnt how to set up Putty and using that to set up a server. Although we could not properly interact with our server so I feel the task will only get harder.

### Week 6

As I predicted last week the server task only got harder. We had to implement a script that could interact with our server and would ideally retrieve data from it too, acting much like a Highscore server. I feel like the past few weeks have proven that there are many specialist skills that I need to improve upon.

### Week 7

During week 7, When I wasn't ill, I worked on Nebula Knights. During this week I spent a lot of time working on errors created by other team members. Although this was time consuming, it was necessary and did help the progress of the game. I feel like this was time well spent aas it meant the game could progress unhindered by bugs. This could point towards my prioritisation skills improving, as there were many other tasks that I could be doing.

### Week 8 

Week 8 was our "Show and Tell" day. I was meant to present our game with another team memeber, but due to illness I couldn't. This was very frustrating for me, and I think the hardest part of this week was dealing with this frustration. I felt like I'd let the team down, which to me, was a big problem. Althought eh talk went very well, it was annoying that I couldn't contribute to this.
